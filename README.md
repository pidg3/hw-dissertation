# Dissertation Code

Code to support my MSc dissertation, looking at robustness of AI explanations. 

Code is all in Python. Dependencies are managed using Conda. You can import dependencies using the environment.yml file: `conda env create --file environment.yml`

Folders are currently organised as follows: 

- `initial-models`: the classification and regression models I am working with to generate explanations. 
- `marabou-testing`: sandbox for experimenting with Marabou and building an understanding of the software. 
- `tensorflow-practice`: sandbox for running through TensorFlow tutorials/courses
- `yel-etal`: copied code from - https://github.com/chihkuanyeh/saliency_evaluation
- `slack-etal`: copied code from - https://github.com/dylan-slack/Fooling-LIME-SHAP
