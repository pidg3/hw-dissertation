# Dissertation Code

Code to support my MSc dissertation, looking at robustness of AI explanations. 

Code is all in Python. Dependencies are managed using Conda. You can import dependencies using the environment.yml file: `conda env create --file environment.yml`

Folders are organised as follows: 

- `notebooks`: the classification and regression models I am working with to generate explanations. 
- `package`: the explanation robustness toolbox package published to PyPI.
